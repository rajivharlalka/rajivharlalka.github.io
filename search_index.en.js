Google is famous for this ability and hence is the most used search engine. But it is afterall the world of technology where things dont stay constant forever. As technology evolves , new and better alternatives emerge.\nFelvin is such of this kind. Since Felvin consumes search data from different search engines, it provides a cherry on top what they provide. Providing a better search experience is what Felvin looks forward to . \nTopic of Work and Motivation behind it\nLooking for code syntax, implemenations and snippets are the daily needs of any developer. This becomes a lot tedious a lot when this simple task requires the user to jump between sites to find relevant data. Making an instant app for Reference Implementation of Code Snippets was the topic that I took up as my project.\nImplementation of my work\nThere exists various open source project where algorithms in various languages have been compiled. Two of them were Rosetta code and The Algorithm. Their code snippets was kept in well maintained directory structure which I used to compile a single json using a js script. After the json was made , much of the task was done.\nA simple API service which took the query string and parsing the algorithm and language was enough to look for the specific code snippet. This code snippet was sent over over to the React app(or instant app in Felvin's terminology) where the input was passed down to the Monaco editor component which rendered on the user's screen. The main benefit of using the Monaco Editor rather than custom styling a textbox was the inbuilt vscode feature it provides, Code Suggestions \nDemo:\nSample Query :here\n\nIn short , I spend my winter learning , breaking stuff and building connections with new people around. Thanks to Harsh for providing this opportunity and being a great mentor along the way and Sahil for the consistent much-needed help during the whole time.\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/felvin-intern/","title":"Spending Winter in an ideal Way"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/gsoc-post-2/":{"body":"Hi all, Hope you are doing great!\nThis is the first biweekly post of my learning and understanding about PostgreSQL and the community alongside working on my proposal. My project is about creating an extension in Postgres that captures statistics and helps in monitoring of a running server.\nDuring the community bonding period(3th May,23 - 28th May,23), I spent most of my time understanding about the features on an high level, to look forward of what could be exactly important with respect to my project.\nIt wasn't late that I understood that there isn't anything in Postgres that doesn't need monitoring. Every single SQL queries creates lots of changes internally to produce the desired result. PostgreSQL collects a number of statistics but what it doesn't do is what pg_statviz tries to fulfill. Provide cumulative statistics over timerange to analyze changes overtime.\nModules Increase\nThere were multiple tables/views which I found that could provide valuable insights if queried over long time. Analysis on some of them are:\nUptime\nHaving an uptime statistics is useful to know the count of server crashes in that time interval. \nThe pg_postmaster_start_time() function in psql helps to fetch the time when Postgres started, which can be easily utlilized to fetch the uptime.\nLocks\nPostgres offers 8 types of locks on tables. Each lock has it's utility and level of blocking access to different SQL queries. \nHigh number of concurrent locks can be a reason of high response time of DML SQL queries. As the avg number of locks increases, more the queries need to wait to be processed. \nThe internal postgres view pg_locks provides details of every lock currently applied on every table in the database.\nWhile mode column in pg_locks tells which type of lock is applied, the pid tells the pid of the connection creating that lock.\nBut what if a table wants an Exclusive lock on a table which the another lock is already imposed?\nIn that case the connection needs to first wait to obtain that lock causing delays. A false value granted column indicates that lock is needed but isn't granted , meaning connection waiting for lock, and the waitstart tells the start time for the wait of lock. This is pretty useful to observe incases the wait time exceeds a lot.\nUser Tables and Indexes\nIt's pretty fascinating to understand what goes behind the scene of DDL and DML queries on tables. Inserting rows does not imply data is written instantly to disk and deleting doesn't mean the row is permanently lost. \nMVCC or Multi-Value Concurrency control is a feature in Postgres which handles multiple values accross various transactions. A values getting deleting from one transaction doesnt mean getting wiped off from others, kudos to MVCC. \nThe pg_stat_user_tables and pg_statio_user_tables provide statistical information about the tables created by a user, and similar views exist for index too.\nThe *_blks_hit refer to the rows which needed to be fetched from the disk and *_blks_read refer to fetching from the cache. This value helps in understanding the cache hit/ read ratio which indicated how many times the cursor needed to go to the disk to fetch a row. Higher the value, more the query response time.\nAn important column is the n_dead_tuple which indicated the rows which have been updated or deleted and are no longer needed by any running transactions. The next time vacuum runs, these rows are permanently removed from the server.\nSimilar views exist for table which help in getting to know how many times an index was utlized over a seq scan on that table. Incase the index is less utilized, it is an appropriate time to understand and tune the table indexes and constraints on which indexes are built. \nTesting over platforms\nSince the views have been developed slowly over the years, there is a high chance that every view might not be available in all the latest version. Hence Testing over all readily maintained version of Postgres was needed.\nTo implement that, I created a Github Action that checks the extension over all major versions (&gt;=10) parallely in matrix formation. \nTo do this I too help of the PGXN Tool Docker Image which builds and starts a Postgres cluster in a docker container. \nPost the Cluster is started, the extension is installed and Regression tests are run to check the working. The Github Action for my tests can be found here.\n\nUnderstanding the utility of these views, I created respective modules utilizing these views/tables which can be more explored in this Pull Request.\nHave also been active on multiple platforms such as Slack, Reddit and mailing lists of PostgreSQL trying to understand people's queries and answering a few. \nAlso have been trying to maintain an readily updated public Gist with my findings, readings and learning these days. Would be happy to answer any queries over any media and am open to suggestions to ideas if any :). \nFin.\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/gsoc-post-2/","title":"Getting started with GSoC@PostgreSQL"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/gsoc-post-3/":{"body":"TLDR: My GSoC has finally ended. Can read about the development done on the Final Report and here's the repository link: Repository. It was a great experience overall, got to learn a number of things, and things were pretty exciting.\n\n\n\nThere's a famous saying, All well that ends well, and my GSoC \"official\" coding period has ended. This proverb shows me how my last few months have changed my perspective on Tech differently.\nMy Journey\nIt all started more than a year ago when one of my friends  got accepted as a contributor to GSoC 2022. I wasn't due to my procrastination and laziness. I was enthusiastic about open source and believed that GSoC was the gate to help me with it.\nIn over a year, my interest in database internals increased, and soon, it was time for the GSoC'23 project announcement. Only in February'23, I was committed to a hackathon and couldn't devote any time to my proposal. Still, I just had the GSoC's schedule in my mind. February ended, and I got free from almost everything. And I was so free that suddenly I got tensed.\nWhile lying down, let's try it this time, owing to having a month left for proposal submission. I was clear from the start of creating just one proposal, and that too for a project in PostgreSQL (I love the DB). My project hunt began, but it was easy since it was limited to PostgreSQL.\nThe main thing I looked at in my choice of project was to get to tinker with internals. I saw this in pg_statviz, where I had to go deep into every possible internal statistic the database could produce and how that could be churned into getting critical information.\nAfter spending more than 4 months on the project, it feels surreal that I believed a proposal accepted is monstrous.\nMy Learnings\nWorking as a project, getting better technically was obvious. Along with every technical aspect I won't be detailed here, I got the time to sit and think a lot about several things. For more than half of my contributor period, I was having my university summer vacation, so I was at home. I chose not to travel and give some time to myself.\nIn these few months, my perspective on software engineering has changed drastically. Writing more code does not necessarily mean creating an impact. My mentors asked me to read and understand how PostgreSQL works during the community-binding period. I couldn't understand the logic at that time as I wanted to write code. Lots of code. But now that I feel why that was important. Understanding what to write and building a feature that is actually needed is essential.\nCommunity. I have heard several times from various people that being a part of a community helps, but I never understood this. PostgreSQL's community is massive. People are present on most social discussion platforms and mailing lists. The way of interaction, and the discussions happening over to talk about how even the minutest feature should be incorporated moved me. I was never a person who would think so much before proceeding to write code. Minor changes were discussed thoroughly, and the people available to guide and help others made me realize the power of open source.\nNow that the coding period has finally ended, I look back to what I was, and it makes me feel happy to see progress. Software has become closer to me. I feel more thoughtful than reckless while thinking of a solution to problems. I am not even aware of hundreds of issues, and yet it fascinates me to understand things better. It exhilarates me that I am a member of such a community, and looking forward to more experiences.\nMy final report and work have been summarized here: Final Report. Repository\nSpecial thanks to my mentors, Jimmy Angelakos, Pavlo Golub, and Boris Mejías , for their constant support, guidance, and motivation. Also, the PostgreSQL Community has been beneficial, and developers guided me throughout the project.\nThanks to various seniors and people I had during this journey, now I tread forward to learn more.\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/gsoc-post-3/","title":"Ahh, Here's the end ft: GSoC'23"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/kwoc-2021/":{"body":"How does it feel to be a mentor, student and a developer of the platform all at once. I would like to tell how I felt it. Kyool !!\n\nBackground\nEvery winter, Kharagpur Open Source Society organises a month long coding program KWoC. The aim of the program is to give a experience of how events such as GSoC are held and promote Open Source Contributions. Mentors having different project are given a platform to upload their idea and students all around the world are eligible to register for the event. After successful completion of the program, the students are provided with a certificate.\nFrom a Developer's POV\nAs a member of the society , I was one of the person helping organize the event. I took up the work of adding features and making changes required to the backend repository , that being my field of interest. Though I worked with javascript all this time, picking up a golang backend was kinda not in line of my daily work. But going out of mainstream work is what I crave for. So yes, I went on to grab the opportunity.\nLearnt golang from scratch , wrote some basic programs to get accustomed to the langugae and went on to understand the already written codebase. The backend used mux as a http request handler,gorm as an postgres ORM and a supabase postgres instance as a database.Thanks to the well written code a the comments of the previous dev, understanding that wasnt much pain in the ass .\nIn a span of next 15 days, I designed some new api endpoints and updated some old. Add foreign keys to the database(❤️) table which were missing last year . Got to know something new called Eager Loading. Also had my first experience setting up nginx and deploying the backend binary to an AWS EC2 server.\nFrom a Mentor's POV\nOur platform was ready just in time and we were ready to go. To test out all our platform's functionality, I added one of my project , Accio as a project . Yes , you saw it correct, it's the same theme that powers this blog. I was already a lot behind my schedule in setting up this blog and saw this as a opportunity to get my work fastened. What started as a joke ended up me mentoring a project.\nI took my companion Chirag as my co-mentor as he was the one helping me on the project as well. We made our discord server for communicating with the mentee's . To my surprise , my project had gathered a lot of attention. Being an Open Source mainter is tough, felt this during the time. Had an idea of talking to contributors while one my seniors Sahil mentored me in some of the projects. Was able to solve mentee's issues and tried to do good code review. Hoping the mentee's had a great time contributing to my project too.\nFrom a Student's POV\nAlong with working on my project(Accio), I was also actively contributing to another project , Instant-Apps by Felvin . Havent you popped up with some fancy tool apps by Google for some specific search queries. Felvin aims to make them accessible to the most basic tasks. Users wont have to crawl different pages to get their work done when everything can be done by the search engine itself. \nThis project taught me so much , I cant even think to jot it down. From understanding how to use git and github the right way to going to making React apps, styled components (somethng which I would never thought of using) , it has been a long way. Special credits to Sahil Shubham for responding to my most useless queries :simple_smile: \nOh, you reached the end of my shitty story. Congrats on that 🎉 . Would come again with some another shitty story, some another shitty day . Till then See Ya!\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/kwoc-2021/","title":"Being all in one"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/magic-with-generate-series/":{"body":"Hi everyone,\nRecently I was pretty much involved in reading and understanding different parts of PostgreSQL, especially the cumulative and static statistics collector.\nEven more, the concepts of wal, replication, and archiving being some of the building blocks of how PostgreSQL handles multiple transactions were fascinating.\nTo test different features, I needed data. And that too lots of data. I nearly filled my 1 Terabyte HDD generating test files to check out all types of queries, short-lived and long-running.\ngenerate_series is a function in PostgreSQL which was my helper in all the tests. It's a simple function that takes 3 arguments, start - end, and interval, and generates rows in that range. Using multiple tweaks these simple functions can be used to generate a variety of data which can be extremely helpful in understanding PostgreSQL.\nHere are some of the tricks I read/learned/used to generate sample data for lots of testing.\nInteger Series\n-- Simple generation of integers 1..10 and 1,3..17,19\nselect generate_series(1,10),generate_series(1,20,2);   -- https://dbfiddle.uk/7nzIxoc3\n\n-- decreasing sequence\nselect generate_series(20,10,-1); -- https://dbfiddle.uk/VM6rK88I\n\n-- series of random integers\nselect (random()*100)::integer from generate_series(1,10); -- https://dbfiddle.uk/h9GW9Kl2\n\nCharacter and Strings\n-- a sequence of characters\nselect chr(i) from generate_series(48,57) i; -- https://dbfiddle.uk/ts78-LdF\n-- a sequence of repeating characters\nselect repeat('*',i) from generate_series(1,10) i; -- https://dbfiddle.uk/1KZ6GBDu\n\nA bit complex query to generate names can be done using this:\nselect (\n    select string_agg(x, '')\n    from (\n        select arr[(random()* 31):: int % 10]\n        FROM\n          (\n            SELECT\n              '{AO, AB, MC, ED, OF, JE, NC, OQ, BN, KE}':: TEXT[] as arr\n          ) as name_syll,\n          -- three-syllable words\n          generate_series(1, 3 + id*0)\n      ) as name_syll(x)\n  ) as name\nfrom generate_series(1, 10) as id; -- https://dbfiddle.uk/5Nvx3xkw\n\nThe most important part here is the id*0 which forces a new name to be generated on every iteration. It has zero contribution in calculating the value but it makes the string_aggregator run again for every new value of name.\nTimestamping Time\n-- days of a week\nselect generate_series(timestamp '2023-06-25', timestamp '2023-06-25' + interval '1 week', interval '1 day'); -- https://dbfiddle.uk/88f5ZQQ6\n-- first and last days of every month of a year\nselect\n  id,\n  id + interval '1 month - 1 day'\nfrom\n  generate_series(\n    timestamp '2023-01-01', timestamp '2023-12-01',\n    interval '1 month'\n  ) id; -- https://dbfiddle.uk/3VAuatDu\n\nSome fun Tweaks\nGenerate All IPv4 Addresses in CIDR Notation\nselect\n  (a::TEXT||'.'||b::TEXT||'.'||c::TEXT||'.'||d::TEXT):: CIDR from\n(\n  generate_series(0,255) a\n            cross join\n  generate_series(0,255) b\n            cross join\n  generate_series(0,255) c\n            cross join\n  generate_series(0,255) d\n);\n-- https://dbfiddle.uk/dgvEkDCW\n\nCaution before executing this query: The number of rows would be 256^4 = 4,294,967,296 ~ 4.2 Billion and will take up lots of space. I tried this on my system with addresses starting with 0 (0.*.*.*) and taking 5 minutes of execution, the table size was ~14 GB hence perform at its own risk.\nA Normal Distribution\nFrom PostgreSQL 16, a new function random_normal is being included in the core which will make this easy. Till then writing the functions manually is the best bet available.\n-- Referenced from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53687946/beta-and-lognorm-distributions-in-postgresql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION norm(N INTEGER, mu FLOAT = 0, sigma FLOAT = 1)\nRETURNS SET OF FLOAT AS\n$BODY$\nSELECT\n    sigma*sqrt(-2.*ln(random()))*cos(2*pi()*random()) + mu\nFROM\n    generate_series(1, N) AS i;\n$BODY$\nLANGUAGE SQL;\n\nselect norm(10000);\n\nGenerating data with weights\nSuppose we want our data to be generated as follows:\n\n75% of data should be 1\n15% of data should be 2\n5% of data should be 3\n3% of data should be 4\nRemaining 2% should be 5\n\nAfter some trying and testing, could come up with a function that works this way:\nSELECT\n    values. value\nFROM (\n    SELECT\n    -- 10000 here are parts which represent 100 by extrapolated\n        FLOOR(random() * 10000) AS random_value\n    FROM\n    -- Here the end is the number of values needed to generate.\n        generate_series(1,1000000) i\n    ) x,\n    ( VALUES\n        (1, 0, 7500),     (2, 7501, 9000),  (3, 9001, 9500),\n        (4, 9501, 9800),  (5, 9801, 10000)\n    ) AS values (value, strt, ending)\nWHERE\n    x.random_value BETWEEN values.strt AND values.ending;\n\nThis works in a way that it generates a random_value and for each such value checks which values.value fits in the range of start and end each weight.\nThe start and end are weights but extended from 100 to higher powers for more granular control.\nTo test this I performed a test to check the percentage of each value generated and here is the result:\nidfloat8\n10.750275\n20.149736\n30.05017\n40.029985\n50.019834\n\nCan try it out yourself at https://dbfiddle.uk/3yBKJYFz.\nI also found another way of doing this after celebrating my joy of writing this function. It was a  blogpost by Depesz which uses a for loop to find random values in the range. Clever.\n\nMost of the ideas originated while I found some articles/blogs/problems where a dataset was needed to understand and analyze the query better.\nIg that would be it for this one too.\nFin.\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/magic-with-generate-series/","title":"Magic with Generate Series in PostgreSQL"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/music-blog-1/":{"body":"Have recently started with trying different sorts of music, so each part of this post series would probably have a different flavour of music.

Any feature that a user needs which isnt there natively can be added using extensions. to distribute extensions on different systems, packaging becomes important.\nThis blog lists down the steps to package a PostgreSQL extension in debian/ubuntu systems. I would be packaging a simple base36 extension to list down the steps.\n1. Adding the sources list\nTo install postgresql packages in debian, the apt.postgresql.org apt list needs to be added. \n# Reference: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt\n# Add gpg keys for verification\ncurl https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/apt.postgresql.org.gpg &gt;/dev/nul\n#For downloading packages\nsudo echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list\n#To also be able to download source files of packages deb-src also needs to be added\nsudo echo \"deb-src http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\" &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list\n\nRun apt install to update the apt list repositry and be able to search for packages using apt command.\n2. Setting up the directory\nGet your extension source code in a directory. Next from the root of the extension directory, call dh_make_pgxs to setup the boilerplate for the debian folder. \nvagrant@ubuntu-focal:/vagrant/base36-0.0.1$ dh_make_pgxs\nUpstream (-n): base36\nVersion (-v):  0.0.1\nSource:        base36 (0.0.1-1)\nBinaries:      postgresql-PGVERSION-base36 (0.0.1-1)\nUploader:       &lt;vagrant@localhost&gt;\nHomepage (-h): https://FIXME/base36\n\nPress Enter to continue, ^C to abort\nInstalling debian/control.in\nInstalling debian/copyright\nInstalling debian/gitlab-ci.yml\nInstalling debian/pgversions\nInstalling debian/rules\nCreating debian/source/\nInstalling debian/source/format\nCreating debian/tests/\nInstalling debian/tests/control\nInstalling debian/tests/installcheck\nInstalling debian/watch\nUpdating debian/control from debian/control.in\nCreating debian/changelog\n\nPost this a debian folder would be created. It has same structure of what dh_make creates hence the meaning of the files can be found anywhere on the internet.\n3. Updating necessary files\nAfter updating the nexecassry parts, the folder is ready to be built(incase of procedural languages) and packaged.\n4. Build the extension\nPostgreSQL has a cli tool pg_buildext which is extremely helpful in building the package. A great documentation of it is available on the manpage .\n5. Package the extension\nThe final step comes to packaging the extension. To just verify there must be a README.* file in the root of the extension. \nRun the dpkg_buildpackage if a tarball of the source code already exists and  dpkg_buildpackage -b if not. This would test the extension on the supported pg versions and then create the necessary deb files ready to be shipped.\nvagrant@ubuntu-focal:/vagrant/base36-0.0.1$ dpkg-buildpackage

Big thanks to Pavlo Golub for organizing this month's PGSQL Phriday.\nMy PostgreSQL journey began quite years back when I just started out with programming and I needed a database. On the first result to my Google search - \"The best database in the world\" - was PostgreSQL and hence I chose it. And this December I would be presenting a talk about my GSoC project at the largest PostgreSQL Conference being held in Prague.\nMy official entry into the PostgreSQL community took place in March 2023, as I sought discussions on project ideas for Google Summer of Code'23. Jimmy, my initial contact within the community, left me impressed with the supportive nature of the entire community. Within a few days, I found myself acquainted with more members, immersed in countless blogs and articles, and captivated by the vibrant world that predominantly thrives through chat interactions.\nAs I now look forward attending my first conference, I envision a multitude of opportunities unfolding. First and foremost I would get to meet my mentors and people with whom I got to engage from the last few months. This conference promises a significant learning curve, providing ample opportunities for feedback and engaging discussions with both the audience and fellow attendees. I aim to strengthen my community bonds by communicating with those I haven't had the chance to interact with, delving into their past experiences within the community. This, in turn, will serve as a wellspring of inspiration for my projects and contribute to my professional development goals. Additionally, I'm excited about the prospect of visiting Prague, a magical city during the festive Christmas season.\nAmidst these expectations, there's an undercurrent of nervousness as I prepare to deliver my first-ever talk on such a grand stage. Striving for perfection, I focus on crafting compelling slides, refining the flow of my presentation, and injecting well-timed humor. Drawing insights from numerous videos on effective public speaking, I aim to adhere to best practices and avoid common pitfalls.\nIn a general sense, I have a great excitement about the overall atmosphere of the conference, including the venue, presentations, and the energy of a community coming together.\nCheers!\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/pgsqlphriday-14/","title":"PGSQL Phriday #014: PostgreSQL Events"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/prague-diaries-1/":{"body":"One afternoon in January this year, while working on a project I made an entry to my private bucket list. Give a talk at a conference and scheduled it to be done within the next 10 years. At that moment I had no idea the how/what/when of happening of this event. One year ago myself would be smiling at me now when I strike this wish/feat off the list in 11 months.\nI was selected as a contributor to the PostgreSQL organization during Google Summer of Code'23. One day while having a casual discussion with my mentors, I was asked if I was interested in speaking about my experience and the project at an upcoming conference in December. Since my college was to be on a vacation during the proposed timeline, I thought this to be an amazing opportunity. Few days ago, I was a fortunate to make it to the conference and it was an absolute bliss.\nThe Conference\nPostgreSQL Conference Europe 2023 was scheduled from 12th December to 15th December 2023 in the city of Prague, Czech Republic. This was my first conference and even my first travel out of my country. I was to talk about my GSoC project pg_statviz at the conference and also communicated to the organizers for being a part of the volunteering team.\nThe Travel\nI made all my plans perfect and left home on 11th to reach the location on 12th according to plans. But not all things work as they are planned. The 22 hour flight was converted to a super long 46 hour flight itinerary when one of the connecting flight, Delhi to Istanbul,  got cancelled and I was re-routed for the next via Mumbai. After being inches away from cancelling my entire trip, I finally reached the venue on 13th late night with 3 hours of sleep in the last 48 hours. I was hell tired.\nI had already missed a day of the conference and was quite sad about it. On reaching the venue, I got to meet a number of people, some with whom I had been chatting over emails and Slack for the last six months. It was an absolute pleasure of getting greeted after this long journey. The news and story of my travel had already spread among the other folks at the event and it became an easy conversation starter for me. Listing everyone I met would be super difficult for me, but for a few names Andreas, Dave Page, Boriss Mejias, Jimmy Angelakos, Tomas Vondra, Floor Drees, Pavlo Golub, Jonathan Katz, Chelsea Dole would be some of them. I was overjoyed connecting and sharing my story with them.\n\nThe First Day (for me)\nThe next day started out with talks on SQLPage by Ophir, about using roaring bitmaps by Ants Aasma and solving IOT usecases with PostgreSQL by Chris. I got a good chance to interact with these speakers since I was also room hosting for them in their respective slots. I missed the next two talks, as I was in my room preparing myself for my talk, nervousness and stage-fear already started to kick in. \nMy Presentation\nI went over my slides quite number of times and then a chat with some friends to relieve my anxiety. From outside I was prepared, but inside me was an erupting volcano of nervousness. I arrived at the hall 10 mins before my talk to setup my system and was glad to find Boriss and Pavlo there to help me out during the presentation. Devrim was my room host, and we had a good chat on various things, from how I got to know him to his effort in getting the pronunciation of my first name right. \nIn a couple of minutes, I was ready with my mic and screen-sharing setup and took a deep breadth to calm myself. To cheer myself up, I took a quick selfie to have a memory of me with the big screen with my slides. It was time and after the introduction by Devrim , I started my talk. The start was difficult but once I picked up pace, it started getting comfortable. I tried keeping the pace to not run fast but soon I realized I was ahead of time and running out of slides. When I starting speaking on my experience during GSoC, I took a step out of my slides and started to talk from my heart. It was this part I wasn't prepared to speak on and neither did I know I would need to. It was a call from the moment and I took it. I spoke on my experience, different people I got to connect to and my overall experience with the community. Once I was contended, I continued with my slides and slowly ended my talk. Next followed some minutes of Q/A where some good questions came up, though I don't remember them now. Now I felt a sense of relief. The various videos suggested by Boriss on how to be a first time speaker were really helpful. It was done, I could finally strike the item off my bucket list. Since my talk was the last of the day, I along with my friend Akshat, went out to explore Prague and we had a good time exploring the city.\n\n  \n  \n\nThe Second and Final Day\nNow it was time for the final day. Couldn't believe that the conference was ending so soon. One by one, I got to attend talks on various topics and they were super great. I also took the opportunity of visiting booths setup by different sponsers and meeting them, understanding what's cooking there and had great chat with them. Some of the people I remember are Hans-Jürgen Schönig from Cybertech, Adam Hendel from Tembo, Tejasvi Kashi from PGEdge, people from Ubicloud and Adam Wołk and Paul Meyer from Microsoft. Having get to connect to them was quite insightful in a number of ways and our chat didn't limit to PostgreSQL. I remember talking about my career path and maybe-decisions with Adam infront of Tembo's booth. These chats made me feel more inclusive in the community as being someone quite new and starting out, it was a different experience I could have. Next we had a series of lightning talks which was amazing. And in no-time was the Closing remarks with various metrics about the conference. I was thrilled to see that the conference had a participation of 720 attendees, which is said to be the largest among all PostgreSQL conferences worldwide till date. With the ending group photographs with all the speakers and some parting gifts the conferences ended in reality but for me, I wanted more. But things have to come to an end some day and this was it. I had got presents for my mentor's and saw this the perfect time to hand them over too. It was my pleasure being guided by them. I also got to meet an Indian, Arindam Guha, at the conference. It was a great pleasure meeting someone from my country there and we had a good time chatting with him over number of things. \n\n\nThat night, I was invited along for a Karaoke party at Brutal Panda Bar and we had lots of fun singing, dancing and making merry. Karaoke was something I had never done before and I hate myself for my own singing. Apologies to everyone there who had to hear my singing but for me, it was utmost pleasure. I never thought shouting at the top of my lungs could be fun. We were accompanied by some other folks and soon we started singing songs of some language I didn't understand (according to some it was Russian,and from some it was Czech, though it doesn't matter) but that turned out to be super amazing again. I specially thank Floor Drees for the plan and having me there.\nFinally it all ends\nFor the last day(next day when the conference ended) of most people, we left the venue to explore the city and see what's there for Christmas. Since some of the people had to leave in the evening, we took a quick ferry ride on the Vltava river and the view was surreal. I also met some new people and recognized Matthias in a sec, though I misremembered him from reading his blogposts by reading his comments on Slack. We sat on the same table along with Boriss and Akshat, having gossips all along the ride. It was soon late afternoon and people had to slowly leave to catch their flight. Akshat and I also took our leave and moved ahead to explore more about the city.\nSince I had already planned by trip by taking extra three days to travel and explore more what the city had to offer, I got to see a number of places and connect to number of more new people. I would leave this for another blog, but for the conference it ended here. \nSpeaking at PostgreSQL conf EU was one of the biggest feat for me in the last couple of months(years?) and I brought a number of great memories with me from the event. I could understand how a community bonding helps in building software, and how the community supports one another and how it unites as a family. And now I feel happy to be a part of this community. I would like to thank the entire PostgreSQL community for making me feel so inclusive, there wasn't a  moment I had to feel I am meeting people for the first time. Another big thanks to PostgreSQL.EU organizing committee for having me there and sponsering my trip, I possibly would not have been there without your support. And also thanks to my parents, friends and people at KOSS who's constant support and help has kept me guided.\nFin.\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/prague-diaries-1/","title":"Prague Diary - Unforgettable experience at PGConf EU"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/recursive-macros/":{"body":"We all know about Recursions, right?\n\nGoogle defines Recursions as: \nA process or a concept that involves repeating items in a self-similar way.\n\nRecursions is considered a quite complex topic when it comes to programming in C. \nEven NASA prohibits the use of recursive functions in their code.1\nBut what if that very recursion can help in code formatting blazingllllly fast.\nAbstract\nSince the past few months, I have been trying to adapt myself with the vim (yes ik NeoVim is better) ecosystem. To start with it, I chose not to directly jump with using Nvim but use the VScode Extension Vim , that provides most vim features inside VScode itself. This has helped me learn the bindings better without going through the pain of writing my own NVim dotfiles first. \nHence I have two workflows at the moment:\n\nUse Vscode with Vim Extension: When need to do things fast.\nUse NVim with my less understood config: When I can take time writing code and finding better keymaps of doing things faster.\n\nProblem\nRecently I was migrating an old Python2 script to Python3, and the main pain came when I needed to convert all print string to print(string). There were around 120 of such converions.\n#Small snippet of code\ndef load(self, program_description):\n  proc_id = self.new_process()\n  tmp = program_description.split(':')\n  if len(tmp) != 2:\n    print 'Bad description (%s): Must be number &lt;x:y&gt;' % program_description\n    print 'where X is the number of instructions'\n    print 'and Y is the percent change that an instruction is CPU not IO'\n    exit(1)\n\n\nMacros looked the best way to do this the fastest. So a simple qqqqqwd$i(&lt;Esc&gt;pq macro when the cursor is on the print word.\nExplaining the macro:\n\nqqq - Clear the q register.\nqq - start recording macro on q registor\nwd$ - delete and store everything in line except the (` before starting the macro did the work.)print(word) \ni(&lt;Esc&gt; - Enter the insert mode, add the opening braces and go back to normal mode.\npq - Paste the content to be inside braces and end recording the macro.\n\nThis macro was ready to be used using @q. \nA Better solution\nWhat suddenly popped into my mind was if I used the macro to even call itself. A simple append change in the macro and making it\nqqqqqwd$i(&lt;Esc&gt;pn@qq and triggering a search using /print before starting the macro.\nWhat the extra n@q does is automatically move to the next find of the print keyword and start the macro again. \nBut here starts the doom. With having a basic idea of how search using / works in vim, it is understandable that this would not stop ever. \nOnce the cursor reaches the end of last print in the file, it starts to find the keyword again from the start of file and will execute the macro again on the already formatted lines. This can lead to variety of abnormalities depending how you file was structured.\nSolution to Problem\nSo a basic intution is to see how to stop the macro from running once it reaches end of file. \nAnother point to be noted is macros stop running if any command in the macro fails. So we need to redesign the macro such that it detects end of file. Have not yet found a very brilliant solution to this yet, would update when have one.\nWas referred to a solution of using this vim command :g/print/normal f'i(^[f'a) where ^[ is Escape character on reddit but this doesn't solve the issue completly too. \nExceptions\nI too ended up in few exceptional cases which I had to fix manually in the end. Some of them were,\n\nLines ending with a , . This made it terrible as some lines had , in the middle too and splitting only from the end was pain.\nStrings having print too. This was the most frustrating exception. The line string truncated again from the middle and threw things haphazard. Though a solution of this could have been made by always moving to next line and then to the first word, but yes I got lazy. \n\nWould like to know if anyone has any solution to this problem. :)\nFin.\n\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/recursive-macros/","title":"Recursive Macros"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/start-with-passion-gsoc23/":{"body":"\nThis post is about my journey from reading about DBMS and Relational databases to actually getting to work on them. Recently Google Open Source Team released the GSoC'23 results and I am glad to be selected to contribute for the prestigious PostgreSQL org. \nMy journey with the love of databases all started from when Shubham Mishra, my college senior, gave me the task of presenting a 15-min talk on Database Management System as a part of KOSS interview process. That 1 week of learning made me inspire to what I would get to do for the next few months.\nThe start of all of it\nWhy Open-Source\nBecause Community is what makes you better. Open Source is all about working about working in public and indulging in arguments on why not this. It's easier to accept someone else's idea than finding a better solution to it. This is where community plays a pivotal role, where people of all mindset come together to argue on nitty-gritties of software engineering. \nI believe it might be easier to build out something in the corner but what if nobody actually uses it. Having a community also helps in getting constant feedback on the demand of people who are actually in the same domain. \nAlso the joy of helping others doesn't go un-counted.\nWhy GSoC\nI believe I had the motivation of trying GSoC mainly because of three reasons:\n\nGreat way to spend summer working in public and develop a great project.\nGet to meet new people from the community and having understand their journey.\nMoney\n\nWhy PostgreSQL\nI had been greatly curious in understanding the internals of how databases work. and any simple google search in relevant topic would pop up one of postgresql's as the top search result. This motivated me more towards reading about PostgreSQL in general and it's manual became my Gita for database, a goto place for all my queries. \nLooking at the list of proposed projects for GSoC'23 , I found pg_statviz very interesting and hence I went for working on a proposal for it.\nMore about my project\npg_statviz is a modular and minimal PostgreSQL extension that captures cumulative dynamic as well as static statistics about a running PostgreSQL server. Time Series analysis on stored statistics would provide invaluable information in solving bottleneck issues and tuning performance of the server.\nA python command line tool would help in generating graphs to help these statistics visually. \nThis project would help me understand better about the different internal tables and understanding postgresql's working.\nI would thank my senior Shivam Kumar Jha and Yash Sharma for being my constant source of motivation throughout my Proposal period.

In this writeup I would briefly discuss what I learnt and understood and maybe posts respective to each topic might follow-on later.\nThe main places where I had been acquiring knowledge were blogs by depesz , PostgreSQL documentation and watching conferences on Youtube. Examining the different features which PostgreSQL offers, it was quite remarkable to see that how the SOLID principles apply here. Seperability of Concern was something quite visible, each part has it's own function and it is best at doing it's job without interfering others. Below are some of them which I found quite Interesting to talk\nGUC: Grand Unified Configuration\nGUC or Grand Unified Configuration are some configuration parameters in PostgreSQL which control the working of every other part. There are 350+ GUC stored in $PGDATA/postgresql.conf that can be tuned. Every GUC has a different function and the .conf file has been seperated nicely as per the category in their function is.\nProperties such as work_mem, shared_buffers control the memory usage of the server , while seq_page_cost, random_page_cost help the query planner undestand a better plan to find the data.\nConfigurations around Logging, Replication, Vacuuming are all present in the same configuration file segmented out in parts to be used as necessary. The conf file also allows include directives incase someone wishes to have seperate files for every Segment. Such cases are helpful when one wishes to have different configuration quite often, such as a vacuum.conf.day and vacuum.conf.night soft linked to vacuum.conf as per need. This even helps in easy knowing which configuration is currently used by just checking the file which the main config is linked to (using ls -la).\nThere are multiple interepretation of anomalies happening due to incorrect values of GUC's. For example: A large number of temporary tables being created indicates less work_mem as data is spilled to disk and temporary tables are created to sort, and anaylze rows.\nLogging\nPostgreSQL offers varieties of option to configure Logging. Apart from an stdout,  logging as a csv, json and syslog are available. \nApart from the other granular details, one important thing to use and notice is log rotation. Once set, the file in which log is to be written changes automatically. This is useful in cases if logs of specific day and time is to be visualized. \nWAL: Write Ahead Log\nThis is another type of log but not exactly log. Wal files help in event of crash to rewind and restore the database. It also helps in reducing the number of disl writes sync making the queries faster. There is an another process running that cleans up these WAL files and flushes data to disk once transactions related to them are complete.\nConfiguring the value of max_wal_size and checkpoint_timeout one can change how fast or slow checkpointers are going to flush the value in disk. Frequent checkpoints help in faster recovery incase of crashes but it comes at a cost 1. Very frequent checkpoints can cause higher wal production, resulting in a unexpected i/o.\npg_dump and pg_basebackup\nThere are various cases where data from a server needs to be shifted/copied to anther location/server. Postgres provides two major ways of doing it.\n\npg_dump (Logical Replication)\npg_basebackup (Physical Replication)\n\nIn case of pg_dump or Logical Replication, Postgres generates a SQL file that if replayed in another new Postgres server, would generate the exact same data. It flushes all the rows ,tables and users necessary to create the replica of the server. Indexes need to be created again since pg_dump generates the SQL that can create the same index again. This is a disadvantage as it might take hours to generate everything back again.\nA workaround for this is replicating using basebackup , which does physical replication. The replicated instance is ready to be up and running in seconds.\n\nSo, why even do a pg_dump? \n&gt;Physical Replication are more error prone in case the system configurations do not match. OS versions, Locale settings are soemething that needs to be checked in such cases 2\n\nThis would be it for this post, would be reading more about each part individually and soon try to write seperate posts for them.\nFin.\n\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/understanding-postgresql/","title":"Understanding PostgreSQL"},"https://rajivharlalka.in/year-2023/":{"body":"After thinking 10s of time how to start this, ig this would be the beginning. I planned on a number of things for this year, and this decade; some got fulfilled, some didn't. It's time to carry-over some of those debts to the next year in the hope to get them full-filled. Each of them could be categorized in one of many self-made buckets, and would arrange those in the form of sub-headings.\nFriends\nMost of my time in the recent years have been revolving around my friends. Even to my accomplishments in JEE, I would give lots of credits to my friends who helped me during the study and sad time. Even for most of the time I remember myself, I find lying down in one of my friend's room munching the snaks they got from home. To most of my ideas, my thoughts, my celebrations and my emotions are associated to some friend.\nThough I felt in the last few months, I have been drifting away from most of my friends in terms of ideas and thoughts. I guess I don't want to have that conversation again because their thoughts becoming my critic, but isn't that needed too? I believe I have been avoiding people who work/say/think quite against/opposite mine and tend to reject their opinions without thinking a lot.\nResolution: Try to think on every suggestion/opinion thrown at me and try to fair to myself.\nBooks\nThis is one of the habits I have been dearly trying to acquire but failing every time. This year I merely read 2 books.\n\nMetamorphosis by Franz Kafka\nThe Shiva Trilogy: The Immortals of Meluha by Amish Tripathi\n\nThough it isnt true that I didn't try to pick more, but for most of them, it was always boil down to leaving them midway. Having heard from most people that not all books are meant to be read completely, but I don't think I am a good judge at this moment to have the opinion to either complete or read it to the end.\nResolution: To try to grow this 10x i.e. have 20 meaningful reads in 2024. I would try to account them all on my Goodreads to have a regular account to myself.\nTech\nEvery time I read a tech blog, I understand this is something new. There is always a more to things. And this parts excites me the most. I wish to strive for the day when I can say to myself, \"I am the best in xyz\". Learning everyday has become one of my routines and this is something I wish to continue forward. To list fown, here's my tech setup I had for 2023:\n\nPhone: Iphone 14 (though used my Samsung M31 for most of the year, now switched completely to iOS)\nLaptop and OS : Dell G3 3500 with Arch Linux &lt;3\nMonitor: SAMSUNG 24 inch IPS Backlit\nMouse: Dell MS 116\nKeyboard: Cosmic Byte Artemis 68 Key\nOccasional Server Uses: Azure VM's\n\nI discovered Omnivore and use it for most of my reading usecases. It solved most of my pain-points, and love it's support for PDF's and maling lists.\nResolutions: To get better, everyday. Read and go hands-on with projects. Try something ususual.\nMovies and TV series\nThough I don't watch a lot of movies or tv series, I restrict myself to one's recommended to me. This helps me to stop thinking and discovering what to watch and keep myself contended to limited content. Generally I love Thriller Suspense genre, but am open to watch all. This year some of my favourites were:\n\nSe7en\nAsur Season 2\nJojo Rabbit\nRick and Morty\n\nResolutions: Keep having fun.\nWriting\nI am glad I improved on this field. Number of blogs in the year '23 were 3x of that of 2022 and had enjoyed writing them. Though wanted to document more on my learnings and daily life. Pen-Paper Journalling was something I wanted to try but couldn't accomplish.\nResolutions: Try different forms of journaling, and keep it consistent. Regarding blogging, keep it consistent with the current rate.\nFitness\nThis year's summer did not have a good impact on my physical fitness since I was mostly sitting on my working table and had least workout. Tried with playing Squash and am loving the game. Mind and body becomes so refreshing after each game, it feels great. Another reason for loving the game is the great people and coach over there.\nResolutions: Maintain a regular fitness plan, have a better exercise routine. Be able to run two consecutive 2.2 in a go.\nTravel\nBe it deep valleys or rivers with sparkling water, from peaky mountains to sandy deserts, each terrain has it's own beauty and it's quite intribuing to understand about each of different places. Even though two different places can have similar terrain, they always something more to offer. This year, though I didn't get to visit a number of places, each of the place has deep memories in me. Some of them would be:\n\nMandarmani Beach - Even though this beach is quite near to KGP, it was after four years of my college life, I could get to visit this place. It was a great experience with some of good friends.\nJaipur and Sakhu\nDarjeeling - The Queen of Hills of India, with friends is a must visit. Even though my trip was a short one, it was quite memorable. From great sunrises to the lush green tea gardens, it was a mesmerizing view. Again a must visit.\nPrague, Český Krumlov and Kutná Hora - My first International trip after attending PostgresConf Europe. This calls for another post.\n\nResolutions: Visit more places, talk to more people and keep the introvert me outside.\nI believe these buckets complete more than enough all the things I had in mind, if not listed maybe didn't fall into the buckets and I don't remember it anymore. Excited to see myself in 2024. For ending here's some of my memories from 2023.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\nFin.\n","id":"https://rajivharlalka.in/year-2023/","title":"Year 2023 and Resolutions for 24"}},"docInfo":{"https://rajivharlalka.in/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://rajivharlalka.in/felvin-intern/":{"body":202,"title":4},"https://rajivharlalka.in/gsoc-post-2/":{"body":469,"title":3},"https://rajivharlalka.in/gsoc-post-3/":{"body":358,"title":5},"https://rajivharlalka.in/kwoc-2021/":{"body":347,"title":2},"https://rajivharlalka.in/magic-with-generate-series/":{"body":492,"title":4},"https://rajivharlalka.in/music-blog-1/":{"body":48,"title":6},"https://rajivharlalka.in/packaging-extensions-in-debian/":{"body":828,"title":5},"https://rajivharlalka.in/pgsqlphriday-14/":{"body":229,"title":5},"https://rajivharlalka.in/prague-diaries-1/":{"body":814,"title":6},"https://rajivharlalka.in/recursive-macros/":{"body":376,"title":2},"https://rajivharlalka.in/start-with-passion-gsoc23/":{"body":257,"title":5},"https://rajivharlalka.in/the-setup/":{"body":95,"title":1},"https://rajivharlalka.in/turning-22/":{"body":82,"title":2},"https://rajivharlalka.in/understanding-postgresql/":{"body":428,"title":2},"https://rajivharlalka.in/year-2023/":{"body":544,"title":4}},"length":16},"lang":"English"};
