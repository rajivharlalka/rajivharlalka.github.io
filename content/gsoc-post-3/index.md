TLDR: My GSoC has finally ended. Can read about the development done on the [Final Report](https://github.com/rajivharlalka/gsoc23-postgres/blob/main/Final_Report.md)and here's the repository link: [Repository](https://github.com/vyruss/pg_statviz). It was a great experience overall, got to learn a number of things, and things were pretty exciting.

There's a famous saying, `All's well that ends well` and now after that my GSoC "official" coding period has ended, this proverb comes back at me on how my last few months has changed my perspective to view a number of things differently. 

## My Journey

It all started more than a year ago, when one of my friend `<name-redacted>` got accepted as a contributor to GSoC 2022 and I wasn't due to my procastination and laziness. I was enthusiastic about open source a lot and I believed that GSoC is the gate to help me with it. 

In over an year my interests in database internals increased and soon it was time for GSoC'23 project announcement. Till February'23 I was commited in an hackathon and I couldn't devote any time for my proposal but I just had the GSoC's schedule in the back of my mind. February ended and I got free from almost everything, and I was so free suddenly I got tensed. 

While lying down, I thought of lets try it this time owing of having a month left for proposal submission. I was clear from the start of creating just one proposal and that too for a project in PostgreSQL (I just love the db). My project hunt began but since it was limited to PostgreSQL it wasn't that hard.

The main thing I looked in my choice of project was to get to tinker with internals. This was something I saw in `pg_statviz` where I had to go deep into every possible internal statistic the database could produce and how that could be churned into getting critical information. 

After spending more than 4 months on the project it feels how surreal it was that I believed a proposal accepted is monstrous. 

## My Learnings

Working as a project, getting better technically was obvious. Along with every technical aspect, which I won't be detailing here, I got the time to sit and think a lot, on a number of things. More than half of my contributor period I was having my university summer vacations and hence I was at home. I made the choice of not to travel too and give some time to myself.

In these few months my perspective over software engineering has changed drastically. Writing more code does not necessarily mean creating an impact. During the community-binding period, my mentors just asked me to read and understand how PostgreSQL works. That time I couldn't understand the logic as I wanted to write code. Lots of code. But now that I feel why that was important. Having to understand what to write and building a feature that is actually needed is important. 

Community. Having heard a number of time from various people that being a part of community helps, but I never understood this. PostgreSQL's community is massive. People are present over most social discussing platforms and mailing lists. The way of interaction, the discussions happening over to talk about how even the minutest feature should be incorporated moved me. I was never a person who would think so much before moving to write code. Small changes were discussed thouroughly, people available for guiding and helping others made me realize the power of open-source.

Now that the coding period has finally ended, I look back to what I was and it makes me feel happy to see progress. Software has become closer to me. I feel more thoughtful than rekless while thinking for a solution to problems. There lie hundreds of problems that I am not even aware of and yet it fascinates me to understand things better. It elates me that I can say myself a member of the such a community and looking forward to more experiences.

Special thanks to my mentors [Jimmy Angelakos](https://github.com//vyruss), [Pavlo Golub](https://github.com/pashagolub), [Boriss Mej√≠as](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boriss-mej%C3%ADas-4637401)
, for their constant support, guidance, and motivation. Also, the PostgreSQL Community has been immensely helpful and developers guided me throughout the project.

Thanks to various seniors and people I had during this journey, and now I tread forward to learn for more.
