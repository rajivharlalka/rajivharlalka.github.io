After having this long sought plan of listing my bucket list somewhere in a written format and publicly available, have finally started to work on it, and should be soon on this domain. I recently turned 22, and am glad could spend it the way I wanted. 

Last year around the same time, I had wished to spend my next birthday on top of a hill laying down gazing at the stars relaxing with the people I know. I was able to execute this, though on a smaller scale, as I went with my friends to Ananthagiri Hills a day before and planned camping for the night and a small 2 hour trek the next morning.

Last year has been quite happening to me, given I was able to tick some bucket list items planned for a long future. Got selected for GSoC, my first international solo trip, got a chance to speak at a conference,
