Hello There

 I am Rajiv, a Second Year Undergraduate Student at IIT Kharagpur. From spending my time either reading some random article on the internet to having a nice talk with my friends on [2.2](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2.2) , my time has been passing by recently. I am into writing code in Javascript and Go , have developed a low key-hate for Python. Recently had a exposure on containerization and  orchestration tools whose working parts fantisized me a lot. Plannng to explore Databases as Distributed systems in the near future.

 Am part of a group of Open Source ethusiasts , [Kharagpur Open Source Society](https://kossiitkgp.org) where we conduct Workshop, seminars on Git,Linux and other Tools to spread the word about Open Source among the college students. 

 Can find me anytime listening to Moozic of all sorts which have a soothing tune. Nah, Drums don't amuse me. Why pain the ear when can have a soft sound soothen the mind. 

 Here's my soothing playlist for you :)
