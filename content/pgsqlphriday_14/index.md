The topic of this month’s [PGSQL Phriday #014](https://www.pgsqlphriday.com/2023/11/pgsql-phriday-014/) community blogging event—where people from different companies and different countries all blog about the same topic on the same day—is PostgreSQL Events. Big thanks to [Pavlo Golub for organizing this month's PGSQL Phriday](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/pgsql-phriday-014-postgresql-events/).

My PostgreSQL journey began quite years back when I just started out with programming and I needed a database. On the first result to my Google search - "The best database in the world" - was PostgreSQL and hence I chose it. And this December I would be presenting a [talk](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2023/callforpapers/4797/) about my GSoC project at the largest PostgreSQL Conference being held in Prague.

My official entry into the PostgreSQL community took place in March 2023, as I sought discussions on project ideas for [Google Summer of Code'23](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). [Jimmy](https://vyruss.org/), my initial contact within the community, left me impressed with the supportive nature of the entire community. Within a few days, I found myself acquainted with more members, immersed in [countless blogs and articles](https://gist.github.com/rajivharlalka/f9a54c95eeafeef58734e2006f957fed), and captivated by the vibrant world that predominantly thrives through chat interactions.

As I now look forward attending my first conference, I envision a multitude of opportunities unfolding. First and foremost I would get to meet my mentors and people with whom I got to engage from the last few months. This conference promises a significant learning curve, providing ample opportunities for feedback and engaging discussions with both the audience and fellow attendees. I aim to strengthen my community bonds by communicating with those I haven't had the chance to interact with, delving into their past experiences within the community. This, in turn, will serve as a wellspring of inspiration for my projects and contribute to my professional development goals. Additionally, I'm excited about the prospect of visiting Prague, a magical city during the festive Christmas season.

Amidst these expectations, there's an undercurrent of nervousness as I prepare to deliver my first-ever talk on such a grand stage. Striving for perfection, I focus on crafting compelling slides, refining the flow of my presentation, and injecting well-timed humor. Drawing insights from numerous videos on effective public speaking, I aim to adhere to best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

In a general sense, I have a great excitement about the overall atmosphere of the conference, including the venue, presentations, and the energy of a community coming together.

Cheers!
